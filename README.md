Astana E-Commerce Analytics

Astana E-Commerce is a growing online marketplace that connects customers with a wide range of products, including electronics, fashion, home appliances, and more. With thousands of daily transactions, the company generates valuable data about customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

This project aims to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data to support better decision-making in areas such as marketing, logistics, and product management.

The Astana E-Commerce Analytics Project demonstrates how structured transaction data can be used to answer key business questions.

Key analytics include:

Total sales revenue by region and category.

Top 10 best-selling products.

Customer lifetime value (CLV).

Monthly/seasonal sales trends.

Average order value (AOV) per customer.

Seller performance (orders, ratings, revenue).

Payment methods distribution.

Refunds and cancellation rates.

New vs returning customers.

Logistics performance (delivery time & delays).

The project will evolve step by step throughout the trimester. Each assignment will add new functionality ‚Äî from database setup ‚Üí SQL queries ‚Üí Python integration ‚Üí visualization dashboards.
